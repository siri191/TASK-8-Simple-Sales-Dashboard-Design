# TASK-8-Simple-Sales-Dashboard-Design
This repository contains Task 8 of my Data Analyst internship at Elevate Labs, featuring an interactive Superstore Sales Dashboard built in Power BI. The project leverages the popular Superstore dataset to deliver actionable business insights through advanced data visualization and analysis techniques.

The dashboard is designed to monitor sales, profit, and key performance indicators (KPIs) across different regions, categories, and customer segments. By integrating slicers, drill-down capabilities, and custom visuals, it enables business stakeholders to quickly identify high-performing areas, spot declining trends, and make data-driven decisions.
